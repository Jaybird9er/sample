						<h3>How It Works</h3>
							<p>
								Swapper helps you to save by helping you exchange, or rather buy, currencies on exchange marekts via your local bank in Korea. Typically, traders who deal in Foreign Exchange (FX) markets use a myraid of technical indicators to determine the best time to make trades. Swapper does away with the need for all that by boiling down the indicators into a simple graph that tells you when it's best to buy a currency. And once you've bought a currency, you can use Swapper to alert you when it's time to sell a currency and earn a profit.
							</p>
						<h3>One Price: 5,000&#8361;</h3>
						<p>
							Well that's not quite right. The first three months are free. It's 5,000&#8361; every month after that. You can stop whenever you like either by shutting down your account, or letting your payments lapse. You can even take breaks by suspsending your account, so you don't have to pay for your account while you're away on holiday. And when you log back in again, all of your information will be right where you left it.
						</p>
						<h3>A Full-Service Service</h3>
						<p>
							Swapper goes beyond being just an investment guideance service. Swapper will help you:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Provide guides on how to set up the proper accounts for trading currencies</li>
							<li>Avoid fees that come from trading currencies</li>
							<li>Get the most out of the money you wire abroad</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Secure.</h3>
						<p>
							Unlike most financial services, Swapper does not link to any of your bank accounts. Furthermore, since personal data is nearly just as valuable as your banking data, a Swapper account requires only an email account. This makes your data much easier to protect and also makes the setup process a breeze.
